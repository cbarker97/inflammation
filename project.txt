Project kickoff meeting:
Some initial data analysis to identify how inflammation changes over time after surgery

Jane is a Data Scientist and Samit is a statistician. We will need to determine who is responsible for what in this project.

We may need to bring in a third person with Python programming skills into this project. 

We imagine this person will need to know about Pandas and Matplotlib. 

This person should also know how to use numpy arrays for data analysis.
